# CS2820 Fall 2024 WARP Project Code

This codebase is used for the University of Iowa CS:2820 Introduction to Software Development course section 0AAA of F24. The original author and developer was Steve Goddard of the University of Iowa for the WARP sensor network research project and has undergone multiple iterations, transitioning from Swift to Java and finally into an object-oriented programming style. This specific fork serves as a testing ground for learning software development principles.


## Interaction

WARP is interacted with via the command line interface (CLI). The primary command is `warp`, followed by various argparser options that can be supplied to modify behavior. Users can specify the network workload and topology, which consists of real-time flows between sensors, controllers, and actuators.

## Project Overview

WARP (Wireless Adaptive Real-time Programming) is a novel approach designed to meet the demands of future Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) applications. Traditional software synthesis relies heavily on SMT solvers and resource-rich machines. WARP adapts these techniques for embedded devices and wireless networks, offering real-time, reliable performance despite network dynamics.

Key Features of WARP:
- **Data Plane**: Programs specify network operations more expressively than traditional schedules.
- **Software Synthesis**: Generates programs that meet real-time flow deadlines and reliability constraints.
- **Control Plane**: Manages workload and network topology changes efficiently.

## README Disclaimer

Please be aware that Eclipse's markdown file previewer does not appear to be a WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get) markdown editor, as markdown formatting does not correctly parse (i.e. doesn't show correct amount of bullet point indentation level). When considering the README.md, please read it as it is parsed by GitLab, not by Eclipse. It looks much prettier and understandable when formatting is parsed correctly.


## Project Setup

No special installation or setup is required. The project is designed to run directly in Java, and users can interact with the project via the CLI using the `warp` command.
