# CS2820 Fall 2024 WARP Project Code
This code base will be used for the University of Iowa CS:2820 Introduction to Software
Development course by ccolin. The code was developed by Steve Goddard for the WARP sensor network 
research project. It was first written in Swift and rewritten in Java. It was then 
rewritten again in an object-oriented programming style. This will serve as the play-and-testing ground for Software Development.
Either omit the --all argument or use in conjunction with the "-sch priority" scheduler argument.
