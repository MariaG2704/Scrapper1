# CS2820 Fall 2024 WARP Project Code
This code base will be used for the University of Iowa CS:2820 Introduction to Software
Development course by ccolin. The code was developed by Steve Goddard for the WARP sensor network 
research project. It was first written in Swift and rewritten in Java. It was then 
<<<<<<< HEAD
rewritten again in an object-oriented programming style. It was a quick
hack, and it needs a lot of cleanup and refactoring. A perfect code base to teach
the value of software developement fundamentals!
- remember that you need to go to run configerations and add [-i NAMEOFTEXTFILE -o OutputFiles -sch priority -v --all -gui] to arguments to see your paths 
- remember that if you are adding --all to run config you probably have to have -sch priority before that because many directories have a lot of files or change Warp to not run every scheduler option when using --all
- to open a txt file in excel, all you need to do is right click the txt file and select open with, other, and then external programs ( find excel)
